This project is my second mern stack app,
i have earlier done a lot of other project but many of them just simple react application,
damn even i created a total e-commerce site with payment system using only react,

### WHY IS IT SPECIAL
This project is special as here i had finally learned about authentication and implemented it,

### WHAT IS USED
I used firebase auth for authentication,
this is a basic todo app which uses firebase auth for authentication,react for front-end,node for backend, and mongodb atlas as a db.

### WHY IS IT USED
I used firebase auth but that was because it provided directly login using goole or facebook which makes the login process seamless
mongodb atlas is used to create a collection for each user in which there will be various number of documets which are the todos with a unique id
which can be used by react for identifying a unique todo and deleting it
